# Project 3: Community learning

In this project, you will be doing unsupervised learning on an online dataset.

This can be done either through network embedding and clustering or through NLP word/sentence/paragraph/etc. embedding of the text in the dataset and clustering on this.

This project is **fully open-ended**, I encourage you to be creative.

## Requirements

- You generate a new dataset from an online API or scraping. No pre-made datasets!
- You discover underlying clusters (social communities, market patterns, etc.) using unsupervised learning tools we've seen in class (clustering, dimensionality reduction, pre-trained word embeddings, network embedding, etc.)
- Produce a visualization in 2d or 3d of the data (using dimensionality reduction) with the clusters you found tagged. See reddit example below.
- Analyze the produced clusters and use them to provide a short exposition (5-10min) of what you found. One team member can present if desired
